    "The dataset `Customer-Churn.csv` is located at `../2_data/Customer-Churn.csv`. Here is our structured approach to preprocess the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loading the Dataset**:\n",
    "    - Use pandas to load the CSV file into a DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Understanding the Data**:\n",
    "    - Displaying the first few rows of the dataset using `head()`.\n",
    "    - Using `info()` to get a concise summary of the DataFrame, including the data types and non-null counts.\n",
    "    - Using `describe()` to get statistical summaries of the numerical columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handling Missing Values**:\n",
    "    - Identifying columns with missing values using `isnull().sum()`.\n",
    "    - Deciding on strategies to handle missing values, such as filling with mean/median/mode or dropping rows/columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Converting Data Types**:\n",
    "    - Converting categorical columns to the 'category' data type.\n",
    "    - Ensuring numerical columns are in the correct format (e.g., integers, floats).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Encoding Categorical Variables**:\n",
    "    - Using one-hot encoding or label encoding for categorical variables to convert them into numerical format.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Feature Engineering**:\n",
    "    - Creating new features if necessary, such as aggregating or transforming existing features.\n",
    "    - Normalizing or standardize numerical features to bring them to a similar scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Handling Outliers**:\n",
    "    - Identifying outliers using statistical methods or visualization techniques.\n",
    "    - Deciding on strategies to handle outliers, such as capping or removing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Splitting the Data**:\n",
    "    - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, we can ensure that the dataset is clean, well-structured, and ready for further analysis or modeling.\n"

    "The Telco Customer Churn dataset contains information about a telecommunications company's customers and their subscription details. The dataset includes various features such as customer demographics, account information, and services subscribed. One of the columns, `TotalCharges`, represents the total amount charged to the customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Use the Median to Fill NaN Values in `TotalCharges`?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Robustness to Outliers**:\n",
    "   - The median is less affected by outliers and extreme values compared to the mean. In the context of `TotalCharges`, there could be customers with unusually high or low charges due to specific circumstances (e.g., promotional discounts, billing errors). Using the median ensures that these outliers do not skew the imputed values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Skewed Distribution**:\n",
    "   - Financial data, such as `TotalCharges`, often has a skewed distribution. The mean can be heavily influenced by the skewness, leading to imputed values that do not represent the central tendency of the majority of the data. The median, being the middle value, provides a better central measure for skewed distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Consistency with Customer Behavior**:\n",
    "   - The median represents the typical customer more accurately in many cases. For example, if most customers have moderate charges with a few having very high or very low charges, the median will reflect the typical customer’s charges better than the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Avoiding Extremes**:\n",
    "   - Using the minimum or maximum values to fill NaN values would introduce extreme values that are not representative of the typical customer. This could distort analyses and models built on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Scenario in the Telco Customer Churn Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mean**: If the dataset has a few customers with very high `TotalCharges` due to long tenure or high service usage, the mean would be higher than the typical customer’s charges. Imputing NaN values with the mean could overestimate the charges for customers with missing values.\n",
    "- **Median**: The median provides a central value that is not influenced by the extreme high or low values, making it a more reasonable choice for imputation.\n",
    "- **Min/Max**: Imputing with the minimum or maximum would introduce values that are not typical for most customers, leading to potential biases in the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the median to fill NaN values in the `TotalCharges` column of the Telco Customer Churn dataset is a reasonable approach because it provides a robust measure of central tendency that is not influenced by outliers or skewed distributions. This ensures that the imputed values are representative of the typical customer, leading to more accurate and reliable analyses and models."

    "1. **Memory Efficiency**: Categorical data often takes up less memory compared to storing the same data as strings or integers. This is because categorical data is stored as integer codes with a corresponding mapping to the category names.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Performance Improvement**: Many machine learning algorithms and data processing operations can be more efficient when working with categorical data. Operations like comparisons and aggregations can be faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Integrity**: Using categorical datatypes helps ensure that only valid categories are used in the data. This can prevent errors and inconsistencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Statistical Analysis**: Categorical data can be useful for statistical analysis, allowing for easier grouping and summarization of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Model Interpretability**: In machine learning, categorical features can improve model interpretability by clearly defining distinct groups or categories within the data.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Customer Tenure and Charges**:\n",
    "    - The `tenure` of customers varies significantly, ranging from 1 to 45 months in the sample.\n",
    "    - `MonthlyCharges` and `TotalCharges` also show a wide range, indicating diverse service usage and billing amounts among customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Gender Distribution**:\n",
    "    - The `gender_Male` column indicates the gender of the customers, with both male and female customers represented in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Partner and Dependents**:\n",
    "    - The `Partner_Yes` and `Dependents_Yes` columns show whether customers have partners or dependents. In the sample, some customers have partners, but none have dependents.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Phone and Internet Services**:\n",
    "    - The `PhoneService_Yes` and `InternetService_Fiber optic` columns indicate whether customers have phone and fiber optic internet services. There is a mix of customers with and without these services.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Streaming Services**:\n",
    "    - The `StreamingTV_Yes` and `StreamingMovies_Yes` columns show whether customers subscribe to streaming TV and movies services. In the sample, none of the customers have these services.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Contract Types**:\n",
    "    - The `Contract_One year` and `Contract_Two year` columns indicate the type of contract customers have. The sample includes customers with month-to-month, one-year, and two-year contracts.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Billing and Payment Methods**:\n",
    "    - The `PaperlessBilling_Yes` column shows whether customers use paperless billing. Some customers use paperless billing, while others do not.\n",
    "    - The `PaymentMethod_*` columns indicate the payment methods used by customers, including electronic check, mailed check, and credit card.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Churn**:\n",
    "    - The `Churn_Yes` column indicates whether customers have churned. In the sample, there are both churned and non-churned customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Noteworthy Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Diverse Customer Profiles**: The dataset includes a diverse range of customer profiles in terms of tenure, charges, services subscribed, and contract types.\n",
    "- **Churn Analysis**: The presence of both churned and non-churned customers allows for analysis of factors contributing to customer churn.\n",
    "- **Service Usage**: The variability in service usage (e.g., phone, internet, streaming) can provide insights into customer preferences and potential areas for service improvement.\n",
    "- **Billing and Payment Preferences**: Understanding billing and payment preferences can help tailor customer service and billing processes to improve customer satisfaction and retention.\n"

    "- **TotalChargesPerMonth**: This feature provides insight into the average monthly spending of customers, which can be a significant factor in predicting churn. Customers with higher average monthly charges might have different satisfaction levels or service usage patterns compared to those with lower charges. This feature can help in segmenting customers based on their spending behavior and tailoring marketing or retention efforts accordingly.\n",

    "### Handling Outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "The outlier problem in the dataset was addressed using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. Here's how the solution works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identification of Outliers**:\n",
    "    - For each numerical feature, the first quartile (Q1) and third quartile (Q3) were calculated.\n",
    "    - The IQR was computed as the difference between Q3 and Q1.\n",
    "    - Lower and upper bounds were determined using the formula:\n",
    "      \\[\n",
    "      \\text{Lower Bound} = Q1 - 1.5 \\times \\text{IQR}\n",
    "      \\]\n",
    "      \\[\n",
    "      \\text{Upper Bound} = Q3 + 1.5 \\times \\text{IQR}\n",
    "      \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Capping Outliers**:\n",
    "    - Values below the lower bound were capped at the lower bound.\n",
    "    - Values above the upper bound were capped at the upper bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Normalization**:\n",
    "    - After capping the outliers, the numerical features were normalized using the `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn. This transformation scales the features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Normalization**: The mean values of the features are close to zero, and the standard deviations are close to one, indicating successful normalization.\n",
    "- **Capping**: The minimum and maximum values are within a reasonable range, showing that extreme outliers have been capped effectively.\n",
    "- **Distribution**: The quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%) are well-distributed, suggesting that the data is now more robust for further analysis and modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "By capping the outliers and normalizing the data, we ensure that the numerical features are on a similar scale and that extreme values do not disproportionately influence the analysis or predictive models.\n"
