    "## Exploring and Preprocessing the Customer Churn Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset `Customer-Churn.csv` is located at `../2_data/Customer-Churn.csv`. Here is a structured approach to preprocess the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load the Dataset**:\n",
    "    - Use pandas to load the CSV file into a DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Understand the Data**:\n",
    "    - Display the first few rows of the dataset using `head()`.\n",
    "    - Use `info()` to get a concise summary of the DataFrame, including the data types and non-null counts.\n",
    "    - Use `describe()` to get statistical summaries of the numerical columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handle Missing Values**:\n",
    "    - Identify columns with missing values using `isnull().sum()`.\n",
    "    - Decide on strategies to handle missing values, such as filling with mean/median/mode or dropping rows/columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Convert Data Types**:\n",
    "    - Convert categorical columns to the 'category' data type.\n",
    "    - Ensure numerical columns are in the correct format (e.g., integers, floats).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Encode Categorical Variables**:\n",
    "    - Use one-hot encoding or label encoding for categorical variables to convert them into numerical format.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Feature Engineering**:\n",
    "    - Create new features if necessary, such as aggregating or transforming existing features.\n",
    "    - Normalize or standardize numerical features to bring them to a similar scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Handle Outliers**:\n",
    "    - Identify outliers using statistical methods or visualization techniques.\n",
    "    - Decide on strategies to handle outliers, such as capping or removing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Split the Data**:\n",
    "    - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, we can ensure that the dataset is clean, well-structured, and ready for further analysis or modeling.\n"

    "- **SeniorCitizen**: This column is of type `int64` but represents a binary categorical variable, which might be better represented as a category.\n",

    "### Conclusions from the Output Data\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Customer Tenure and Charges**:\n",
    "    - The `tenure` of customers varies significantly, ranging from 1 to 45 months in the sample.\n",
    "    - `MonthlyCharges` and `TotalCharges` also show a wide range, indicating diverse service usage and billing amounts among customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Gender Distribution**:\n",
    "    - The `gender_Male` column indicates the gender of the customers, with both male and female customers represented in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Partner and Dependents**:\n",
    "    - The `Partner_Yes` and `Dependents_Yes` columns show whether customers have partners or dependents. In the sample, some customers have partners, but none have dependents.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Phone and Internet Services**:\n",
    "    - The `PhoneService_Yes` and `InternetService_Fiber optic` columns indicate whether customers have phone and fiber optic internet services. There is a mix of customers with and without these services.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Streaming Services**:\n",
    "    - The `StreamingTV_Yes` and `StreamingMovies_Yes` columns show whether customers subscribe to streaming TV and movies services. In the sample, none of the customers have these services.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Contract Types**:\n",
    "    - The `Contract_One year` and `Contract_Two year` columns indicate the type of contract customers have. The sample includes customers with month-to-month, one-year, and two-year contracts.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Billing and Payment Methods**:\n",
    "    - The `PaperlessBilling_Yes` column shows whether customers use paperless billing. Some customers use paperless billing, while others do not.\n",
    "    - The `PaymentMethod_*` columns indicate the payment methods used by customers, including electronic check, mailed check, and credit card.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Churn**:\n",
    "    - The `Churn_Yes` column indicates whether customers have churned. In the sample, there are both churned and non-churned customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Noteworthy Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Diverse Customer Profiles**: The dataset includes a diverse range of customer profiles in terms of tenure, charges, services subscribed, and contract types.\n",
    "- **Churn Analysis**: The presence of both churned and non-churned customers allows for analysis of factors contributing to customer churn.\n",
    "- **Service Usage**: The variability in service usage (e.g., phone, internet, streaming) can provide insights into customer preferences and potential areas for service improvement.\n",
    "- **Billing and Payment Preferences**: Understanding billing and payment preferences can help tailor customer service and billing processes to improve customer satisfaction and retention.\n"

    "    - **Description**: This feature categorizes the `tenure` of customers into groups: '0-12', '12-24', '24-48', '48-60', and '60+' months.\n",
    "    - **Reason for Creation**: Grouping the tenure into categories helps in understanding the distribution of customer loyalty over time. It can reveal patterns in customer retention and identify which tenure groups are more likely to churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **TotalChargesPerMonth**:\n",
    "    - **Description**: This feature is calculated by dividing the `TotalCharges` by the `tenure`, representing the average charges per month for each customer.\n",
    "    - **Reason for Creation**: This feature normalizes the total charges over the tenure period, providing a clearer picture of the monthly expenditure of customers. It helps in identifying customers who might be paying more or less on average per month, which can be crucial for understanding customer satisfaction and predicting churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance for Analysis/Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "- **tenure_group**: By categorizing the tenure, we can perform more granular analysis on customer retention and churn rates across different tenure groups. This can help in identifying specific periods where customers are more likely to churn, allowing for targeted retention strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TotalChargesPerMonth**: This feature provides insight into the average monthly spending of customers, which can be a significant factor in predicting churn. Customers with higher average monthly charges might have different satisfaction levels or service usage patterns compared to those with lower charges. This feature can help in segmenting customers based on their spending behavior and tailoring marketing or retention efforts accordingly.\n",

    "### Handling Outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "The outlier problem in the dataset was addressed using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. Here's how the solution works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identification of Outliers**:\n",
    "    - For each numerical feature, the first quartile (Q1) and third quartile (Q3) were calculated.\n",
    "    - The IQR was computed as the difference between Q3 and Q1.\n",
    "    - Lower and upper bounds were determined using the formula:\n",
    "      \\[\n",
    "      \\text{Lower Bound} = Q1 - 1.5 \\times \\text{IQR}\n",
    "      \\]\n",
    "      \\[\n",
    "      \\text{Upper Bound} = Q3 + 1.5 \\times \\text{IQR}\n",
    "      \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Capping Outliers**:\n",
    "    - Values below the lower bound were capped at the lower bound.\n",
    "    - Values above the upper bound were capped at the upper bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Normalization**:\n",
    "    - After capping the outliers, the numerical features were normalized using the `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn. This transformation scales the features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Normalization**: The mean values of the features are close to zero, and the standard deviations are close to one, indicating successful normalization.\n",
    "- **Capping**: The minimum and maximum values are within a reasonable range, showing that extreme outliers have been capped effectively.\n",
    "- **Distribution**: The quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%) are well-distributed, suggesting that the data is now more robust for further analysis and modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "By capping the outliers and normalizing the data, we ensure that the numerical features are on a similar scale and that extreme values do not disproportionately influence the analysis or predictive models.\n"
